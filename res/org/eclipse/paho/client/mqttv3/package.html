Contains an API for connecting to a server which implements the MQTT V3 
protocol.

<p>
The MQ Telemetry Transport (MQTT) is a lightweight publish/subscribe protocol 
flowing over TCP/IP for remote sensors and control devices through low 
bandwidth communications. MQTT is used by specialized applications on 
small footprint devices that require a low bandwidth communication, 
typically for remote data acquisition and process control.
</p>
<p>
A typical system might comprise several hundred client devices communicating 
with a single server or "broker", where each client is identified 
by a unique ID. 
</p>
<p>The basic means of operating the client is as follows:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Create an instance of {@link org.eclipse.paho.client.mqttv3.MqttClient}, providing
	the address of the server and a unique client identifier.</li>
	<li>{@link org.eclipse.paho.client.mqttv3.MqttClient#connect(MqttConnectOptions) Connect} to the server</li>
	<li>Exchange messages with the server.
		<ul>
			<li>Send {@link org.eclipse.paho.client.mqttv3.MqttMessage messages} to the server, 
			via {@link org.eclipse.paho.client.mqttv3.MqttTopic topics}.</li>
			<li>Receive messages from the server.  This is done asynchronously
			using  
			{@link org.eclipse.paho.client.mqttv3.MqttClient#subscribe(String, int) subscriptions},
			combined with a {@link org.eclipse.paho.client.mqttv3.MqttClient#setCallback(MqttCallback) callback}.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
<li>{@link org.eclipse.paho.client.mqttv3.MqttClient#disconnect() Disconnect} from the server.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<h4>Publish a message, at most once</h4>
<p>In the following code snippet, a simple message is published to the server,
using defaults wherever possible.</p>
<code><pre>	MqttClient client = new MqttClient("tcp://localhost:1883", "SampleClient");
	client.connect();
	MqttMessage message = new MqttMessage("Hello world");
	message.setQos(0);
	client.getTopic("foo/bar").publish(message);
	client.disconnect();</pre></code>

<p>This is the fastest way of publishing messages,
but is also the least reliable.  There is no assurance that the message will actually be
delivered, and no exception will be thrown if the server refuses the message, or if the
network connection fails.</p>

<h4>Publish a message, once and only once (single threaded)</h4>
<p>In the following code snippet, a message is published to the server
at QoS 2, which is the most reliable delivery mechanism.
In order to achieve this, the message needs to be persisted by the client.
A default implementation of persistence is provided by {@link org.eclipse.paho.client.mqttv3.MqttDefaultFilePersistence}.
This will be used by the client unless an alternative is supplied.</p>
<p>Publishing reliably is more complex, and most of the code is used to handle
error conditions.  The key thing to notice is the two-stage delivery: the first
stage gives the message to the client.  After this, the client is responsible for
delivering the message to the server.  The second stage is about determining 
success or failure.</p>

<code><pre>
	MqttClient client = null;
	try {
		// Create a client to communicate with a broker at the specified address
		client = new MqttClient("tcp://localhost:1883", "SampleClient");
		// Connect to the broker
		client.connect();
	} catch (MqttException ex) {
		System.err.println("Could not connect");
	}
	
	if ((client != null) && client.isConnected()) {
		MqttTopic topic = client.getTopic("foo/bar");
		MqttDeliveryToken token = null;
		// Create message and set quality of service to deliver the message once
		MqttMessage message = new MqttMessage("Hello world");
		message.setQos(2);
		
		try {
			// Give the message to the client for publishing.  For QoS 2,
			// this will involve multiple network calls, which will happen 
			// asynchronously after this method has returned.
			token = topic.publish(message);
		}
		catch (MqttException ex) {
			// Client has not accepted the message due to a failure
			// Depending on the exception's reason code, we could always retry
			System.err.println("Failed to send message");
		}
		
		if (token != null) {
			boolean keepTrying = true;
			do {
				try {
					// Wait for the message delivery to complete
					token.waitForCompletion();
					System.out.println("Message delivery complete");
				}
				catch (MqttException deliveryException) {
					int reasonCode = deliveryException.getReasonCode();
					// TODO: Retry the message, or decide to stop trying
					System.err.println("Message delivery failed");
					if (client.isConnected() == false) {
						try {
							// Re-connect to the server
							client.connect();
						}
						catch (MqttException connectException) {
							// Can't reconnect, so give up.  If and when the 
							// client does reconnect, the message delivery
							// will automatically continue
							keepTrying = false;
						}
					}
				}
			} while (!token.isComplete() && keepTrying);
		}
	}</pre></code>
	
<h4>Publish a message, once and only once (multi-threaded)</h4>
<p>In the following code snippet, a message is published to the server
at QoS 2, which is the most reliable delivery mechanism.
The application uses a {@link org.eclipse.paho.client.mqttv3.MqttCallback callback} to asynchronously be notified 
when delivery of a message has been {@link org.eclipse.paho.client.mqttv3.MqttCallback#deliveryComplete completed}.</p>

<p>
A default implementation of persistence is provided by {@link org.eclipse.paho.client.mqttv3.MqttDefaultFilePersistence}.
This will be used by the client unless an alternative is supplied.</p>

<code><pre>
public class SampleClient implements MqttCallback {
	public void run() {
		MqttClient client = null;
		try {
			// Create a client to communicate with a broker at the specified address
			client = new MqttClient("tcp://localhost:1883", "SampleClient");

			// Connect to the broker
			client.connect();

			// Setup a callback
			client.setCallback(this);

		} catch (MqttException ex) {
			System.err.println("Could not connect");
		}
		
		if ((client != null) && client.isConnected()) {
			MqttTopic topic = client.getTopic("foo/bar");
			// Create message and set quality of service to deliver the message once
			MqttMessage message = new MqttMessage("Hello world");
			message.setQos(2);
	
			try {
				// Give the message to the client for publishing. For QoS 2, this
				// will involve multiple network calls, which will happen
				// asynchronously after this method has returned.
				topic.publish(message);
			} catch (MqttException ex) {
				// Client has not accepted the message due to a failure
				// Depending on the exception's reason code, we could always retry
				System.err.println("Failed to send message");
			}
		}
	}

	public void connectionLost(Throwable cause) {
		// TODO: Implement reconnection logic
		System.err.println("Connection lost");
	}

	public void deliveryComplete(MqttDeliveryToken token) {
		System.out.println("Delivery complete");
	}

	public void messageArrived(MqttTopic topic, MqttMessage message) throws Exception {
	}
}</pre></code>
